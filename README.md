These keywords depend on the language of your browser. Google Calendar recognized only those written in the language in use, not necessarily those in English. It has been translated to the following: UK English, French, German, Italian, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Spanish, Arabic, Hebrew, Portuguese, Thai, Russian, Turkish, Dutch, Bulgarian, Greek, Hindi, Indonesian, Vietnamese, Norwegian, Swedish, Slovenian, Ukranian, Slovak, Lithuanian, Latvian, Hungarian, Finnish, Filipino, Farsi, Danish, Czech, Croatian and Catalan. These languages can also be used in the "learnlanguage" flair for things like "English course," "English class," and "Practice English."

See [en_us/keywords.md](en_us/keywords.md) for the US English list.
